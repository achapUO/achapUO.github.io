                <h2>AJ Chapman</h2>
                <p>Hi! I'm AJ, a first year student at the University of Oregon with plans of taking nursing prerequisites next academic year. I'm Filipino-American and have lived in both the Philippines and USA, and hope to move to Australia in the future! When I'm not doing classwork, I enjoy folk music, playing the guitar, and chatting with friends.</p>
                <p>My understanding of HTML and CSS prior to college was limited to simple text editors on browser games' social forums, such as Transformice and Wolvden. I was driven to take a course in these languages because while I had some interest in them before, I never knew where to start. If I stay at the University of Oregon, I would like to minor in Art and Technology, and if I do transfer to a community college for nursing, I would still want to expand into programming languages as a hobby!</p>
