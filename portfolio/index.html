                    <p>The people of Liyue Harbor greatly revere the mighty and illuminated adepti who dwell in Jueyun Karst.</p>
                    <p>During the festival seasons, they will offer up incense and pray to the adepti for their protection.</p>
                    <p>But none pray to Xiao.</p>
                    <p>For Xiao is no lucky star that promises fame and fortune — he is a demon-hunting Yaksha.</p>
                    <p>After the lantern lights of Liyue have faded, the thankless battle to protect the city goes on unseen. It is an endless battle, and there can be no victor.</p>
                    <p>Still, none of this fazes Xiao, for as the Vigilant Yaksha, he must protect Liyue to honor his contract.</p>
                    <p>This is simply the way it is.</p>

                <p>All the hardships in the world have a name. This one is a millennium of doom that cannot be quelled nor eradicated.</p>
                <p>Even the occasional respite is but ephemeral, and cannot give rise to hope.</p>
